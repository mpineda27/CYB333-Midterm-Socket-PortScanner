# CYB333-Midterm-Socket-PortScanner

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates socket communication and a port scanner implementation in Python, with additional documentation and reflection on security automation practices.

## Objectives
- Build a simple socket communication tool (server/client).
- Create a Python-based port scanner for localhost or scanme.nmap.org.
- Document use of Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis and visualization.
- Practice DevSecOps principles in coding, testing, and documentation.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies (see requirements.txt if present).
3. Run the Python scripts as described in the main report.
4. Refer to Jupyter Notebook screenshots for data analysis examples.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.9+
- Standard Python libraries (`socket`, `os`, etc.)
- [psutil] (if used)
- Jupyter Notebook (for `.ipynb` files and screenshots)
